 - todomvc: a site comparing framworks
 - to avoid collisions with default templating characters (eg '{' when using mustache.js or go lang), you can customize angular's templating character in the config (shim / bootstrapper?)


 - you can use filters within code as well as within directives
 - through much of the tutorial, we declared everything in the global scope
 - remember to inject $http $filter if you use them in the js
 - use alternate syntax when minifying
 - write your own services (they are singletons)
 - angular-js learning github repo
