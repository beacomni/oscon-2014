      "## The importance of communicating your results\n",
      "\n",
      "So, you've done your preprocessing, and you've doen your analysis. Now, you have to communicate your results. Often, you're going to be communicating with people who aren't programmers. Data visualization is a great way to communicate your analyses in clear, meaningful ways. It also allows you to literally see what's going on in your data. (I should note that data visualization is often a great exploratory step, because again, you get to see what's going on in your data.)\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the most important parts of visualization is choosing the best plot for your data. A great visualization shouldn't hide the analysis you've made but enhance it. It doesn't have to fancy or complicated, just clear.\n",
      "\n",
      "## What is matplotlib?\n",
      "\n",
      "Matplotlib is a 2-dimensional visualization library that is very very widely used. You can create a wide variety of plots with it, and you can easily feed in data from other modules in the scientific Python stack, like NumPy, SciPy, scikit-learn, statsmodels, etc. There are a lot of resources online for learning matplotlib, including the matplotlib documentation.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Why matplotlib?\n",
      "\n",
      "Matplotlib is, like I mentioned, very widely used. It's very comprehensive, there's a lot of community support for it, and it's in constant development. It is not my personal favorite, but due to its popularity and comprehensiveness, I would be remiss if I didn't talk about it in this tutorial.\n",
      "\n",
      "## This section\n",
      "\n",
      "All of the examples I'll show here are fairly simple, uncomplicated examples. After trying out a few different plots, we'll switch back over to our census data and see what we can do with that.\n",
