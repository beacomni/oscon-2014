###Langdon White Platform Architect RedHat
 - IDEs and text editors dilemma see blog.osteele.com
    - http://blog.osteele.com/posts/2004/11/ides
  - ides help you know stuff
  - text editors help you learn stuff
  - ides lag on new language features
  - text editors dont help you out as much
##### tools in the forthcoming fedora versions:
 - redhat developer assistant (sets up projects using the language's build tools. the idea is you don't have to remember pip for python, gem for ruby, etc.)
 - software collections -- allow environment switching on the system level 
   like a general purpose virtualenv or rvm 
##### containers
 - why not containers? give a deployment environment, but doesn't do the setup
 - containers + vagrant still very useful in general
